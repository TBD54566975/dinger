# Dinger - progressive web app to show DID to DID communication

_Ping a DID_

# How to use

Browse to https://dinger.web5.website on your favourite device of choice. 

You can use it in a browser, or on a mobile you can add it to your home screen. Once you add it to your home screen it is "installed" and you get a nice icon, and you can share your DID with others so they can ding you.

# How it works

Check out manifest.json and read about PWAs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps 

dinger.js has all the code - index.html the front end. That's it.
